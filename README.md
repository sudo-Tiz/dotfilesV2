# dotfilesV2

My personal dotfiles for a Hyprland-based desktop environment on Arch Linux.

## Overview

This repository contains my configuration files for a modern Linux desktop setup centered around Hyprland (Wayland compositor). 

**Note:** If you're looking for dotfiles for Xorg with dwm, check out my previous repository: [github.com/sudo-Tiz/dotfiles](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dotfiles)

## Quick Setup üöÄ

For easy installation on a fresh Arch Linux system, use my automated setup script:
**[LARBRE](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/LARBRE)** - A fork of Luke Smith's LARBS adapted to my needs that works for both Xorg and Hyprland environments.

## System Information

- **Distribution:** Arch Linux
- **Compositor:** Hyprland (Wayland)
- **Shell:** Zsh
- **Terminal:** Foot
- **Editor:** Neovim (LazyVim)
- **Browser:** Qutebrowser (primary), Firefox & Brave (alternatives)
- **File Manager:** Yazi (terminal), Thunar (GUI)

## Current Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

**These dotfiles are currently in a period of major transition!**

I recently switched from Xorg to Hyprland, which means:
- The configuration is changing regularly as I adapt to the new environment
- Some files still date from the Xorg era and haven't been removed or adapted for Hyprland yet
- Expect frequent updates and changes

If you decide to use these dotfiles, be aware that they might not be in their final state and could contain legacy configurations that are no longer relevant.

## What's Included

- **Hyprland** configuration - Modern Wayland compositor
- **Shell** configuration (Zsh) with custom aliases and functions
- **Terminal** configuration (Foot)
- **Browser** configuration (Qutebrowser) with custom keybindings
- **Media applications**: mpd/ncmpcpp (music), mpv (video player)
- **File management**: Yazi (terminal), Thunar (GUI)
- **Image viewer**: Various image viewers configured
- **Application** configurations and various utilities
- **XDG default programs** properly configured
- **Bookmarks system** using text files for various scripts
- Legacy configurations from my previous Xorg setup (being gradually cleaned up)

### File Organization
- Configs that can be in `~/.config/` are placed there (clean home directory)
- Environmental variables in `~/.zprofile` redirect configs to `~/.config/`
- File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
- Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`

## Submodules

This repository includes two important submodules:

- **[LazyVim](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/LazyVim)** (`.config/nvim`) - My personalized Neovim configuration based on LazyVim

## Legacy Suckless Programs (V1)

My previous dotfiles (V1) were designed around suckless programs:
- **[dwm](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dwm)** - Dynamic window manager
- **[st](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/st)** - Simple terminal  
- **[dmenu](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dmenu)** - Dynamic menu
- **[dwmblocks](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dwmblocks)** - Status bar

These are now replaced by modern Wayland equivalents but the configurations remain available in my [V1 repository](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dotfiles).
